# This is a checklist of items to complete before starting the bootcamp.


* Set up new Github organization. Use this for class repos. 

* Create a new location for example reprexes at R Studio Community. Here is the most recent one: https://community.rstudio.com/t/thread-for-students-in-kanes-data-science-bootcamp-to-post-example-questions/140111

* Update link in Getting Help tutorial with this new location.

* Update link in Final Project tutorial which goes to the spreadsheet students fill out.

* Set up empty project for first class so your set up looks like student set up.



* Be careful about forks. If you have students fork from repo class-2022-08-01, you can not then change the name of this tutorial to class-2022-08-02 and then have them fork from it again. The reason is that these are the same repo, but with a name change, and you can't fork twice from the same repo.
