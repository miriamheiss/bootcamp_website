**Kane's (Free) Data Science Course** is offered occasionally, always running four weeks. The next session starts on **Monday, July 25, 2022**. The workload is 10 hours per week: 3 hours in class with [former Harvard Preceptor David Kane](https://www.davidkane.info/), lecturing live on Zoom at around 8:00 PM EDT and 7 hours of work completed by students on their own. By the end of this course, students will be able to do basic data science! The course is for high school students, but those a bit younger or older are always welcome. There is no charge.
