Classes run from 8:00 to 9:00 PM EDT on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.

Two key resources: [*Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) and its [associated tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/). Assignments associated with a specific lecture must be completed before that lecture.

Completed tutorials are sent to kanes.datacamp@gmail.com with your name and the name of the tutorial separated by a semi-colon  --- like "Sarah Jones; Getting Started" --- in the subject line. If you do not complete the tutorials on time, you will be removed from the class. Send in your tutorial answers saved in *rds* format. If you want to save a copy for your own records, use *html*. 

# Week 1: Visualization

Looking at the data is the first step in data science.

## Monday January 23

Reminder: All work must be completed before class. Failure to submit your tutorial answers will result in you being removed from the course. It is not fair to your fellow students, with whom you will be working in small groups, for you to not be prepared for class.

# Week 2: Wrangling

Now that we know how to visualize data that is already clean, we need to learn how to clean up data which might come to us quite messy. To help generate ideas for the final projects, we will also take a close look at US census data.

## Monday January 30

* Complete two Wrangling tutorials: Overview and Plots.

## Wednesday February 1

* Complete API Key tutorial
* Complete Census Data I tutorial.

## Thursday February 2

# Week 3: Data

Now that we know how to clean and organize messy data, we need to learn how to get some data.

## Monday February 6

# Week 4: Projects

The last week will consist of projects that the students will make. Do you love soccer or wine or NYC politics? The final project provides you with an opportunity to study that topic in depth. Your final project will be, for most of you, the first item in your professional portfolio, something so impressive that you will be eager to show it to graduate schools or potential employers.


## Monday February 13

* You must have a draft of your final project ready to go, including a Quarto website and your four sentence introduction.
