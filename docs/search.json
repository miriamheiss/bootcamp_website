      "contents": "\nThis is a rough draft of the proceedures we follow on “Demo Day,” the\nlast class during which students present their final projects.\nThe only material you need for your presentation is a browser which\ncan show both your project’s webpage and your Github repo. We don’t use\nPowerpoint or other nonsense.\nBasic idea is that all students are in two groups: A and B. A\npresents first. Each breakout room includes two students, an A and a B.\n(We will post the assignments.)\nAt the start, we are all in the main room. I offer introductions. I\nopen the rooms. You move yourself to your assigned room. (Guests will\nalso go to the room featuring the student they want to listen to.) Chat\npolitely. I will then issue a Breakout Room message saying to start. The\nA student presents her work for 4 minutes. The B student asks a lot of\nquestions. So do the guests. These questions often involve your code.\nYou can answer them by showing the actual R code in your Github\nrepo.\nAfter three and a half minutes, I send a Message saying: 30 seconds\nleft. At four minutes, I Message “Switch Rooms!”\nPlease switch rooms when I ask you to!\nStudent A stays in the room. Student B moves one room up. From room 6\nto room 7, for example. (If you are the B student in the highest room,\nyou move to room 1.) Then, Student A presents again.\nAfter 40 minutes of this, the A students will have presented 7 or 8\ntimes. Good stuff! I bring back everyone to the main room. Say a few\nwords. And then we do the whole thing again, but with the B students\npresenting and staying put in the rooms. And now the A students move\nfrom room to room.\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Philosophy",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nDetails\nThis section outlines the overall philosophy of the course and some\nimplementation details. You are unlikely to find it interesting! I\ninclude it here for two reasons. First, I believe in transparency. I am\nhappy for students to “see behind the curtain,” to understand the\nreasoning behind my pedagogical choices. Second, I want to provide\nteaching staff with links which they may find interesting.\nFirst, the syllabus\nfor my Harvard class includes a “Course Philosophy” section which\napplies just as much to this class. Indeed, my goal here is to cover the\nexact same material as I would in the first four weeks of that course.\nHighlights:\n\nThe central metaphor for this class is Ulysses and the Sirens. You\nare Ulysses. Ithaca is the future you want. The Sirens are the many\ndistractions of the modern world. I am the rope. No course at Harvard\ndoes more to increase students’ chances of getting the future they\nwant.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Lectures: The worst method for transmitting information\nfrom my head to yours is for me to lecture you. There are no lectures.\nWe work on problems together during class. You learn soccer with the\nball at your feet. You learn about data with your hands on the\nkeyboard.\n\n\nProfessionalism: We use professional tools. Your workflow\nwill be very similar to the workflow involved in paid employment. Your\nproblem sets and final project will be public, the better to impress\nothers with your abilities. High quality work will be shared with your\nclassmates.\n\nSecond, “Kill The Math and Let the Introductory Course Be Born” is an\narticle (pdf) which explains why\nthe course includes no (meaningful) mathematics. Abstract:\n\nOur introductory classes in statistics and data science use too much\nmathematics. The key causal effect which our students want our classes\nto have is to improve their future performance and opportunities. The\nmore professional their computing skills (in the context of data\nanalysis), the greater their likely success. Introductory courses should\nfeature almost no mathematical/statistical formulas beyond simple\nalgebra.\n\nAny introductory course which, for example, does not teach Git/Github\nis doing its students a disservice.\nThird, the heart of the course are the tutorials which\nstudents complete on their own. This essay\nabout how to write tutorials provides some background details.\nHighlights:\n\nImagine the shallowest possible learning curve. Almost every student\nshould be able to answer almost every Exercise, albeit perhaps with the\nhelp of the Hint. There are no hard questions. In fact, there really\naren’t questions at all. Instead, there are instructions: Do this. Do\nthat. Next do this other thing.\n\n\nAssume that you are giving the student a private lesson. You ask them\na question. They give you an answer. What would you say next to them?\nWhat do you want to teach them, given that context?\n\n\nThere are 1,000,000 bits of R knowledge which we might provide to\nstudents: tips, tricks, cool packages, fun websites, et cetera. We don’t\nhave time to mention all of them. The art of teaching is to, first,\ndecide which 10,000 of the bits are most important to mention and,\nsecond, figure out the best time to mention them. Tutorials are a key\nlocation for doing that mentioning. Which bits do we mention and where\ndo we mention them?\n\n\nWe are building a “pit of success.” Generally, students don’t do the\nassigned reading, at least in a large class. But, they will complete\nrequired work. They will do the tutorials. Our promise: If you complete\nthe tutorials, you will become a data scientist. There is simply no way\nnot to.\n\nFourth, I will (try to) ensure that students are always engaged in\nclass, always doing data science. Part of that is the “no lectures”\nphilosophy. Zoom also makes some group-work easy. The rhythm of class\ncenters around solving a specific problem. I say a few words and then\nopen the breakout rooms, each of which includes four students. One\nstudent shares her screen, a different student each time we go to\nbreakout rooms. Another student is the “guide,” the person who tells the\nscreen-sharer what to type. The other two students should be coding\nalong as well. Course staff is moving from room to room, ensuring that\nthe sharing and guiding students are different each time. Course staff\nwill also often, when first entering a room, ask a different student to\nshare his screen. After a few minutes of working as a small group, I\nwill bring the whole class back together. I then ask a random student to\ntell me what their group came up with. Recall:\n\nCold Calling: I call on students during class. This keeps\nevery student involved, makes for a more lively discussion and helps to\nprepare students for the real world, in which you can’t hide in the back\nrow. Want to be left alone? Don’t take this course.\n\nI share my screen with the class, typing what the randomly-selected\nstudent tells me to type, providing commentary on the approach and,\nperhaps, suggesting a different answer. My goal is to ensure that all\nthe student groups are “caught up,” so that when I send them back into\nthe breakout rooms, they can all start from, more or less, the same\nplace.\n\n\n\n",

The course was well-structured and taught me the\nfundamentals of not only producing stunning visualizations in R, but\nmost importantly how to think like a data scientist and manage your code\neffectively. If you are someone interested in dipping their toes in an\nemerging field of data science, this course will guide you well! — Dhruv\nSyngol, Junior, Metea Valley High School\nThe learning environment was exceptional and encouraged me to\nnavigate the basic challenges of RStudio with other students! It’s\nextremely effective for beginner individuals like me to gain this\nexposure! - Joyce Li, Senior, White Oaks Secondary School\nThe final project allowed me to draw from real world data about\nmental health disorders and learn how to make conclusions, moving me to\nbe captivated by the data science field. —– Isaac Frank, Senior, Dublin\nCoffman High School\nThis course was really helpful! I learned a lot about data science\nand how to code in R. My favorite part were the breakout rooms since it\nallowed for students to share ideas and solve problems together. —\nGabriel You (dengxuanjia@gmail.com), Senior, White Oaks Secondary\nSchool\nThe course tutorials were very informative and included an abundance\nof practice to ensure the material was understood. — Daniel Chen (danielc20051218@gmail.com), Junior, Naperville North\nHigh School\nThe course was an interesting way to learn the basics of data\nscience, with the Final Projects being a great way to show what we\ngrasped. — Oliver Raif Altindag (oliveraltindag@icloud.com), Freshman, Newton North\nHigh School\nGreat course overall. Introduces data science really well to people\nwho may not have much knowledge about the field by showing important\nsubjects such as data manipulation and visualization. Although some of\nthe course content was slightly repetitive, it was still extremely\neffective in teaching students both basic and complex topics through the\nuse of peer collaboration and the projects created at the end of the\ncourse. Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants an introduction to\nthe language R and data science. — Abhay Paidipalli (abhay.paidipalli@gmail.com), Junior, James B. Conant\nHigh School\nBeing able to take part of a Harvard course, first of all, is such a\nvaluable experience as you’re able to get a feel of the methodology that\nthese elite institutions use. David Kane’s Data Science Boot camp was\none of the most influential camps I’ve ever attended. Before this\nsummer, I’ve never learned or touched a single piece of code and had no\ninterest in programming, but after taking this course, it’s really made\nme fascinated in computer science, even going as far as planning to\nminor in cs. Working with Preceptor during the camp and under an\napprenticeship really helped me gain valuable experience as well as\nsharpening skills in coding, critical thinking, and discipline. Also,\nit’s completely free. There’s so much to gain from this experience and\nnothing to lose. This camp is definitely one of the best offered to High\nschool students and not one that you should pass on. — Bryan Li (libryan261@gmail.com/ 614-316-1061), Senior, Dublin\nCoffman High School\nThis course was valuable in helping me manage my time during school.\nAlthough I did not have any previous experience in R and Rstudio I had\nto learn to balance my school work and extracurriculars while meeting\nthe demands of the course. — Joseph Jeiwan Kim (josephjwkim04@gmail.com), Senior, White Oaks High\nSchool\nThis course does a fantastic job of not only putting you in the shoes\nof a student, learning the underlying coding and statistics, but also\nputting you in the shoes of a worker, doing real Data Science as a real\nData Scientist. — George, senior, White Oaks Secondary School\n\n\n\n",
